# Night-light 
### Hello everyone.This is not a big project,created specifically for the "AVR ATtiny13" microcontroller. It embodies the concept of a night light or a simple wall light. I personally use this one over the bed - easy to read! For those who will build this project, in the main directory there is a folder named “Nighht_Light_package”. Here you will find parts for the luminaire body in body.step format. If you have a 3D printer, then you are just lucky. The “Nigh light_description_board” folder contains the specification for the boards and boards view. Files required for manufacturing or ordering boards are located in zip archives.

### A special [MicroCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore) kernel helped me write the code and load it into the microcontroller https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore. There is nothing complicated in this, everything is clearly and clearly described step by step on the project page. I myself made such a programmer.
