# Night-light 
### Hello everyone.This is not a big project,created specifically for the "AVR ATtiny13" microcontroller. It embodies the concept of a night light or a simple wall light. I personally use this one over the bed - easy to read! For those who will build this project, in the main directory there is a folder named “Nighht_Light_package”. Here you will find parts for the luminaire body in body.step format. If you have a 3D printer, then you are just lucky. The “Nigh light_description_board” folder contains the specification for the boards and boards view. Files required for manufacturing or ordering boards are located in zip archives.

### A special [MicroCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore) kernel helped me write the code and load it into the microcontroller. There is nothing complicated in this, everything is clearly and clearly described step by step on the project page. I myself made such a programmer.
